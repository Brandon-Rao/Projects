### polybot
This is a discord chat bot I created in python to use for my discord server, it includes functionality that allows for the random sending of images and other entertaining things

### matrix calculator
This is a project I created in python intended to be used for the multiplication of large matrices that would require too much time (and scratch paper) to do by hand. During my time in Linear Algebra classes, I found myself uses calculators such as these alot and wondered if I could make my own, turns out I can and here it is!
